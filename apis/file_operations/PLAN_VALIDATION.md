The plan involves creating a FastAPI application for handling file operations and a Typer CLI application to manage the FastAPI server. The architecture includes:

1. **main.py**: 
   - FastAPI application with endpoints for:
     - Uploading files (`upload_file`)
     - Downloading files (`download_file`)
     - Deleting files (`delete_file`)

2. **cli.py**:
   - Typer CLI application with a method to start the FastAPI server (`run`)

This architecture is viable as it separates the web server logic (FastAPI) from the command-line interface (Typer), making the application modular and easier to manage.
