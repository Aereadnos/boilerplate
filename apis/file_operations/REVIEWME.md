The provided code for both `cli.py` and `main.py` appears to be mostly correct and functional. However, there are a few potential issues and improvements that can be made:

1. **File Upload Handling**:
   - The current implementation reads the entire file into memory before writing it to disk. This can be problematic for large files. It would be better to read and write the file in chunks.

2. **File Upload Path Security**:
   - The code does not sanitize the filename, which could potentially lead to security issues such as directory traversal attacks. It's important to sanitize the filename to prevent such vulnerabilities.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The code does not handle exceptions that might occur during file operations (e.g., file write errors, permission issues). Adding try-except blocks around file operations would make the code more robust.

Here is an improved version of `main.py` addressing these issues:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import FileResponse
import os
import shutil

app = FastAPI()

UPLOAD_DIRECTORY = "./uploaded_files"

if not os.path.exists(UPLOAD_DIRECTORY):
    os.makedirs(UPLOAD_DIRECTORY)

@app.post("/upload/")
async def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    file_location = os.path.join(UPLOAD_DIRECTORY, os.path.basename(file.filename))
    try:
        with open(file_location, "wb") as f:
            shutil.copyfileobj(file.file, f)
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Could not save file: {str(e)}")
    return {"info": f"file '{file.filename}' saved at '{file_location}'"}

@app.get("/download/{filename}")
async def download_file(filename: str):
    file_location = os.path.join(UPLOAD_DIRECTORY, os.path.basename(filename))
    if not os.path.exists(file_location):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="File not found")
    return FileResponse(file_location, media_type='application/octet-stream', filename=filename)

@app.delete("/delete/{filename}")
async def delete_file(filename: str):
    file_location = os.path.join(UPLOAD_DIRECTORY, os.path.basename(filename))
    if not os.path.exists(file_location):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="File not found")
    try:
        os.remove(file_location)
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Could not delete file: {str(e)}")
    return {"info": f"file '{filename}' deleted"}
```

Changes made:
- Used `shutil.copyfileobj` to handle file uploads in chunks.
- Sanitized the filename using `os.path.basename` to prevent directory traversal attacks.
- Added try-except blocks to handle potential file operation errors.
